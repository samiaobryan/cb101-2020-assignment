## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

# Problem 1
```{r}
#After downloading write just a single line of bash to find how many domain types (unique domains) are there in human genome.

cat 9606.tsv | cut -f6 | sort | uniq | wc -l 

#answer = 6537

```

# Problem 2
```{r}
#Using a single wget command download proteomes corresponding to all the Yersinia_pestis strains.

wget -r -nH --cut-dirs=4 -A.faa -I genomes/archive/old_refseq/Bacteria/Yersinia_pestis_* \ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/archive/old_refseq/Bacteria/

```


#Problem 3

```{r}
find . -name "*.faa" -exec cat {} \; | grep ">" | wc -l
#Answer 48772
```

#Problem 4
```{r}
#Using just bash commands can you find out what is the average length of protein in this strain? 
cat NC_000913.faa | grep "^>" | wc -l
#4140 (will be denominator)
echo $(cat NC_000913.faa | grep -v "^>" | tr -d "\n" | wc -c)/$(cat NC_000913.faa | grep "^>" | wc -l) | bc
#Answer 316

#In the second part of the problem, write your commmands in a bash script such a way that given any fasta file as the option to the script, it can print out the average length of protein in the file.
#In shell script Problem_4.sh (below)

#! /usr/bin/bash
echo $(cat $1 | grep -v "^>" | tr -d "\n" | wc -c)/$(cat $1 | grep "^>" | wc -l) | bc

#Then in terminal call
./Problem_4.sh NC_000913.faa
#Anser is 316

```
